            <h3>DIYeSk8Guide</h3>
            <p>DIYesk8Guide is a full-stack web application I developed to provide step-by-step guidance for building and customizing electric skateboards. This project stems from my passion for eboarding and my commitment to empowering others to create their own high-performance electric skateboards.

                The application utilizes a comprehensive technology stack to deliver a seamless user experience. The front-end is built with JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, creating a dynamic and responsive interface. The back-end is powered by Python and Flask, ensuring robust server-side functionality. For data management, I integrated AWS RDS PostgreSQL, providing reliable and scalable database solutions. User authentication is secured with Bcrypt, while AWS S3 handles multimedia content storage. The application is deployed using Render, streamlining the deployment process.
                
                Through DIYesk8Guide, I aim to inspire and assist fellow eboarding enthusiasts, combining my technical expertise with my passion for hands-on creation. This project has not only enhanced my skills as a developer but also strengthened my dedication to building innovative and impactful solutions in the world of electric skateboarding.</p>

            <h3>Esk8Gather (In progress)</h3>
            <p>Esk8Gather is an innovative mobile application designed to connect electric skateboard enthusiasts and facilitate the organization of group rides. This project reflects my dedication to enhancing the eboarding community by providing a platform for users to find, schedule, and join group rides with like-minded individuals who share their passion for electric skateboarding.

                The application employs a robust technology stack to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. The front-end is developed using JavaScript, React Native, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, creating a dynamic and intuitive interface. The back-end is powered by Python and Flask, ensuring reliable and efficient server-side functionality. For data management, the app integrates AWS RDS PostgreSQL, providing scalable and secure database solutions.
                
                Esk8Gather aims to foster a vibrant community by leveraging advanced state management and data handling techniques. The integration of AWS EC2 enhances app scalability and responsiveness, ensuring smooth operation even as the user base grows. Through Esk8Gather, I aim to inspire and connect eboarders, creating opportunities for shared experiences and strengthening the bonds within the eboarding community.</p>
