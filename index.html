            <h3>DIYeSk8Guide</h3>
            <p>
                DIYesk8Guide is a full-stack web application I developed to provide step-by-step guidance for building
                and customizing electric skateboards. This project stems from my passion for eboarding and my commitment
                to empowering others to create their own high-performance electric skateboards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application utilizes a comprehensive technology stack to deliver a seamless user experience. The
                front-end is built with JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, creating a dynamic and responsive
                interface. The back-end is powered by Python and Flask, ensuring robust server-side functionality. For
                data management, I integrated AWS RDS PostgreSQL, providing reliable and scalable database solutions.
                User authentication is secured with Bcrypt, while AWS S3 handles multimedia content storage. The
                application is deployed using Render, streamlining the deployment process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through DIYesk8Guide, I aim to inspire and assist fellow eboarding enthusiasts, combining my technical
                expertise with my passion for hands-on creation. This project has not only enhanced my skills as a
                developer but also strengthened my dedication to building innovative and impactful solutions in the
                world of electric skateboarding.

            <h3>Esk8Gather (In progress)</h3>
            <p>
                Esk8Gather is an innovative mobile application designed to connect electric skateboard enthusiasts and
                facilitate the organization of group rides. This project reflects my dedication to enhancing the
                eboarding community by providing a platform for users to find, schedule, and join group rides with
                like-minded individuals who share their passion for electric skateboarding.
            </p>
            <p>The application employs a robust technology stack to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.
                The front-end is developed using JavaScript, React Native, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, creating a dynamic
                and intuitive interface. The back-end is powered by Python and Flask, ensuring reliable and efficient
                server-side functionality. For data management, the app integrates AWS RDS PostgreSQL, providing
                scalable and secure database solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Esk8Gather aims to foster a vibrant community by leveraging advanced state management and data handling
                techniques. The integration of AWS EC2 enhances app scalability and responsiveness, ensuring smooth
                operation even as the user base grows. Through Esk8Gather, I aim to inspire and connect eboarders,
                creating opportunities for shared experiences and strengthening the bonds within the eboarding
                community.

        <div class="recommendation">
            <p>"I am writing to recommend Kevin Lin who recently completed a coding bootcamp under my
                instruction. I teach software engineering at Flatiron School and Kevin was a student of mine. I
                got to see Kevin's talent and dedication to programming firsthand.</p>
            <p>During the program, we worked on web development using React for the frontend and
                Python/Flask for the backend. The program was 15 weeks long and very fast paced. Kevin was
                able to pick up concepts and apply them quickly. He always took care to make sure he
                understood the concepts. Whenever he did not understand something, he would always ask
                questions or meet with me until they were clear to him.</p>
            <p>For his capstone project, Kevin worked on a website that allowed users to build their own
                customer electronic skateboards. He integrated the OpenAI API into the site and the end result
                looked great!</p>
            <p>Overall, Kevin is a great student and a skilled programmer and I would recommend him for any
                engineering team. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me using
                the contact info below."</p>
